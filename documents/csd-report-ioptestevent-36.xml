<p id="_c8f71c94-8552-45cb-b5f8-e87de6b06aab">A major topic for this event - as for the last one - is trying to make iMip more reliable. In some cases it is the representation of the data which is the issue, other times it is incorrect handling of iTip.</p>  
<p id="_bce80ff9-cc0a-4ab1-ad2b-998b40de6e1b">Another topic which keeps coming back is dealing with differing interpretations of the iCalendar specification regarding recurrences.</p></clause>

  <title>Timezones</title>   
  <p id="_929242d4-9913-49bb-a3df-1cf7cf393686">Do servers handle timezone definition changes - e.g. recalculate recurrences based on new timezone: the answer is usually not.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_vjournal" obligation="normative"><title>VJOURNAL</title><p id="_b66150c6-7b3a-4ee2-a581-8fc95aebafb3">There was a proposal for adding an additional status to indicate “ARCHIVED”</p>   
<p id="_40cbe282-f824-45a8-9bfb-ac5ff337b59b">Suggested alternatives: use different collection, or perhaps a structured category (this is also backwards-compatible, as opposed to a new status)</p>   
<p id="_9119aee0-32bd-48bb-b207-64727cffd757">There is also a lack of rich text support - but that’s also true for events and tasks - this should also be addressed - see “Styled-Description” in <link target="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-douglass-calendar-extension-04.txt"/></p>   
<p id="_a60c6d2e-e919-4382-8bb5-eb39088a69b1">The general feeling is that JOURNAL is not heavily used.</p></clause>  
<clause id="_managed_attachments" obligation="normative">   
  <title>Managed attachments</title>   
  <p id="_659944a7-c99c-483c-b148-67ba08fb3483">Problem: we cannot add an attachment right away together with an event with managed attachments - we would have to first add an event, than once it synced and we know the uid we can add an attachment.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_support_for_wiping_devices_raised_by_marten_from_dmfs" obligation="normative"><title>Support for wiping devices (Raised by Marten from dmfs)</title><p id="_330208fd-0fc8-4373-a1e1-96820e141928">Do we need a special operation?</p>   
<p id="_cf3df59b-1b6f-4a9f-a182-f4e84bdec3f2">The way to go is to use per-device passwords (or OAuth to get device-specific markers) and return empty collections on the first sync.</p>   
<p id="_ede2956d-c63b-46a2-9f17-015dbe214e39">This last point led to a discussion on client authentication and whether we could perhaps support open connect. See</p>
