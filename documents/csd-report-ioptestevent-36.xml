<p id="_df4c1c10-166b-4086-8cbd-71e3c8b1dd67">The event at HongKong continued our move to a more forum like approach, combining testing of new and standard calendar features with a number of in-depth discussions.</p>

<p id="_0aefa6a4-ad06-4036-9115-90a180cfeeeb">A major topic for this event - as for the last one - is trying to make iMip more reliable. In some cases it is the representation of the data which is the issue, other times it is incorrect handling of iTip.</p>  
<p id="_f8007c1c-968c-4b07-88f2-4e909be0ee9e">Another topic which keeps coming back is dealing with differing interpretations of the iCalendar specification regarding recurrences.</p></clause>

  <title>Timezones</title>   
  <p id="_ed619fd4-4b11-4dc0-a182-7d75d2d0ca01">Do servers handle timezone definition changes - e.g. recalculate recurrences based on new timezone: the answer is usually not.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_vjournal" obligation="normative"><title>VJOURNAL</title><p id="_531ba1b3-980c-47a1-a74c-d4f7fc73bda1">There was a proposal for adding an additional status to indicate “ARCHIVED”</p>   
<p id="_a3783d41-91ef-4efa-af26-48b2b9969601">Suggested alternatives: use different collection, or perhaps a structured category (this is also backwards-compatible, as opposed to a new status)</p>   
<p id="_0098c675-cf45-4258-a73c-864110c98c50">There is also a lack of rich text support - but that’s also true for events and tasks - this should also be addressed - see “Styled-Description” in <link target="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-douglass-calendar-extension-04.txt"/></p>   
<p id="_7fb7457f-0c2d-4f2f-8040-e55624936b4c">The general feeling is that JOURNAL is not heavily used.</p></clause>  
<clause id="_managed_attachments" obligation="normative">   
  <title>Managed attachments</title>   
  <p id="_a72d79c8-0d82-4088-aae8-4d357965cf6f">Problem: we cannot add an attachment right away together with an event with managed attachments - we would have to first add an event, than once it synced and we know the uid we can add an attachment.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_support_for_wiping_devices_raised_by_marten_from_dmfs" obligation="normative"><title>Support for wiping devices (Raised by Marten from dmfs)</title><p id="_cf078c1e-035a-4641-8164-5820b08a4f9a">Do we need a special operation?</p>   
<p id="_f4bfbf02-f13c-4d3f-b8fc-8b0f64ce4f27">The way to go is to use per-device passwords (or OAuth to get device-specific markers) and return empty collections on the first sync.</p>   
<p id="_bdd4e000-9942-4813-87ca-a75deb404bbd">This last point led to a discussion on client authentication and whether we could perhaps support open connect. See</p>
