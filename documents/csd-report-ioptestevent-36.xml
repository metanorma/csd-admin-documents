<p id="_e9b3976c-eea8-470a-947f-1218eeda1de3">The event at HongKong continued our move to a more forum like approach, combining testing of new and standard calendar features with a number of in-depth discussions.</p>

<p id="_17bbac76-3aff-4caf-9867-224cd4e8801f">A major topic for this event - as for the last one - is trying to make iMip more reliable. In some cases it is the representation of the data which is the issue, other times it is incorrect handling of iTip.</p>  
<p id="_dea2420c-d3c0-4ac3-826d-19bb3c17b782">Another topic which keeps coming back is dealing with differing interpretations of the iCalendar specification regarding recurrences.</p></clause>

  <title>Timezones</title>   
  <p id="_af8480c3-e233-4c42-b879-f6f2506d93ad">Do servers handle timezone definition changes - e.g. recalculate recurrences based on new timezone: the answer is usually not.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_vjournal" obligation="normative"><title>VJOURNAL</title><p id="_2670ec77-ec4e-4a86-9df4-bf08316a52ba">There was a proposal for adding an additional status to indicate “ARCHIVED”</p>   
<p id="_d0074482-f0e2-4559-866a-581a95dc293d">Suggested alternatives: use different collection, or perhaps a structured category (this is also backwards-compatible, as opposed to a new status)</p>   
<p id="_7d4f768a-1b7c-4a32-8a9b-9805e1a87feb">There is also a lack of rich text support - but that’s also true for events and tasks - this should also be addressed - see “Styled-Description” in <link target="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-douglass-calendar-extension-04.txt"/></p>   
<p id="_76241c72-0e0d-4f00-8876-3659037de7bb">The general feeling is that JOURNAL is not heavily used.</p></clause>  
<clause id="_managed_attachments" obligation="normative">   
  <title>Managed attachments</title>   
  <p id="_6b9ee71d-8da5-4a37-9740-a0ea4778f361">Problem: we cannot add an attachment right away together with an event with managed attachments - we would have to first add an event, than once it synced and we know the uid we can add an attachment.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_support_for_wiping_devices_raised_by_marten_from_dmfs" obligation="normative"><title>Support for wiping devices (Raised by Marten from dmfs)</title><p id="_bbc2897a-99ac-4143-b5a9-99882753f889">Do we need a special operation?</p>   
<p id="_23ffa240-7f1a-49f7-b559-7ac96d9e8814">The way to go is to use per-device passwords (or OAuth to get device-specific markers) and return empty collections on the first sync.</p>   
<p id="_72472e0a-6b36-4d2b-abef-189720d80fa5">This last point led to a discussion on client authentication and whether we could perhaps support open connect. See</p>
