<p id="_e5a5ea3e-f812-4d55-a806-a953fe67be26">The event at HongKong continued our move to a more forum like approach, combining testing of new and standard calendar features with a number of in-depth discussions.</p>

<p id="_2b6ab94f-79ca-4711-b3bc-20a92b427865">A major topic for this event - as for the last one - is trying to make iMip more reliable. In some cases it is the representation of the data which is the issue, other times it is incorrect handling of iTip.</p>  
<p id="_58752010-bbd7-4a2e-b087-cfd1af7eb407">Another topic which keeps coming back is dealing with differing interpretations of the iCalendar specification regarding recurrences.</p></clause>

  <title>Timezones</title>   
  <p id="_9ecc27e7-f890-4f7a-a0f3-b2675ef6a90c">Do servers handle timezone definition changes - e.g. recalculate recurrences based on new timezone: the answer is usually not.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_vjournal" obligation="normative"><title>VJOURNAL</title><p id="_9ccf742e-859b-482e-9e71-c380d5872c3d">There was a proposal for adding an additional status to indicate “ARCHIVED”</p>   
<p id="_1a60a78a-621b-48a8-af44-c8dda771c31d">Suggested alternatives: use different collection, or perhaps a structured category (this is also backwards-compatible, as opposed to a new status)</p>   
<p id="_562cdaea-d836-4b6c-a533-3036908c887b">There is also a lack of rich text support - but that’s also true for events and tasks - this should also be addressed - see “Styled-Description” in <link target="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-douglass-calendar-extension-04.txt"/></p>   
<p id="_2677bef3-82a1-42be-96fe-28eda3a08479">The general feeling is that JOURNAL is not heavily used.</p></clause>  
<clause id="_managed_attachments" obligation="normative">   
  <title>Managed attachments</title>   
  <p id="_49111be9-e944-409f-a236-08be98651465">Problem: we cannot add an attachment right away together with an event with managed attachments - we would have to first add an event, than once it synced and we know the uid we can add an attachment.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_support_for_wiping_devices_raised_by_marten_from_dmfs" obligation="normative"><title>Support for wiping devices (Raised by Marten from dmfs)</title><p id="_753cdda1-fed0-4f08-96fc-2753c3417c28">Do we need a special operation?</p>   
<p id="_215d50c8-b44d-447b-a440-48e3e3543d85">The way to go is to use per-device passwords (or OAuth to get device-specific markers) and return empty collections on the first sync.</p>   
<p id="_2b20f7de-eb83-4f4d-8860-e9d7f69a0d0f">This last point led to a discussion on client authentication and whether we could perhaps support open connect. See</p>
