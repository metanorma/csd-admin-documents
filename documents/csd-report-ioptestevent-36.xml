<p id="_dcba24d9-5851-4b36-94ef-e3f734669472">The event at HongKong continued our move to a more forum like approach, combining testing of new and standard calendar features with a number of in-depth discussions.</p>

<p id="_0d40c7fb-488c-4b3d-b4a9-d860f64732bf">A major topic for this event - as for the last one - is trying to make iMip more reliable. In some cases it is the representation of the data which is the issue, other times it is incorrect handling of iTip.</p>  
<p id="_a1de24f4-4960-4b5c-920a-5eacbad05d67">Another topic which keeps coming back is dealing with differing interpretations of the iCalendar specification regarding recurrences.</p></clause>

  <title>Timezones</title>   
  <p id="_971848c0-469b-4b0e-a2b6-18729b83d163">Do servers handle timezone definition changes - e.g. recalculate recurrences based on new timezone: the answer is usually not.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_vjournal" obligation="normative"><title>VJOURNAL</title><p id="_1684fbd6-3da8-43e1-a82e-9e421378abeb">There was a proposal for adding an additional status to indicate “ARCHIVED”</p>   
<p id="_6c81a57f-5619-42b0-b86b-096ced19549e">Suggested alternatives: use different collection, or perhaps a structured category (this is also backwards-compatible, as opposed to a new status)</p>   
<p id="_b32ce039-05ee-4242-91f6-c59a4822c43e">There is also a lack of rich text support - but that’s also true for events and tasks - this should also be addressed - see “Styled-Description” in <link target="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-douglass-calendar-extension-04.txt"/></p>   
<p id="_e4e57cb0-50d9-494b-ad02-89b2dd625fc1">The general feeling is that JOURNAL is not heavily used.</p></clause>  
<clause id="_managed_attachments" obligation="normative">   
  <title>Managed attachments</title>   
  <p id="_c19f5f6b-6f6b-4140-be8c-a99d506ed705">Problem: we cannot add an attachment right away together with an event with managed attachments - we would have to first add an event, than once it synced and we know the uid we can add an attachment.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_support_for_wiping_devices_raised_by_marten_from_dmfs" obligation="normative"><title>Support for wiping devices (Raised by Marten from dmfs)</title><p id="_eff35216-f73a-4acc-9461-dd46780add36">Do we need a special operation?</p>   
<p id="_d2d43067-470e-492e-b1a3-02c65ec2b30f">The way to go is to use per-device passwords (or OAuth to get device-specific markers) and return empty collections on the first sync.</p>   
<p id="_4c5287fb-bb0c-4e7b-ab19-c4b3527d308d">This last point led to a discussion on client authentication and whether we could perhaps support open connect. See</p>
