<p id="_5fe52c94-8cbd-42e1-8ee0-880c386a561f">The event at HongKong continued our move to a more forum like approach, combining testing of new and standard calendar features with a number of in-depth discussions.</p>

<p id="_52ff5ab3-c20f-4144-8fba-a09b62f78806">A major topic for this event - as for the last one - is trying to make iMip more reliable. In some cases it is the representation of the data which is the issue, other times it is incorrect handling of iTip.</p>  
<p id="_0f7b136b-d106-4647-a864-7756dbf81bd0">Another topic which keeps coming back is dealing with differing interpretations of the iCalendar specification regarding recurrences.</p></clause>

  <title>Timezones</title>   
  <p id="_63b76ca5-34ac-4527-beac-72e3ecce06d4">Do servers handle timezone definition changes - e.g. recalculate recurrences based on new timezone: the answer is usually not.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_vjournal" obligation="normative"><title>VJOURNAL</title><p id="_d869b5c2-586b-4747-b68a-92b5ae7877a4">There was a proposal for adding an additional status to indicate “ARCHIVED”</p>   
<p id="_f5ddcf24-5233-4bba-a8dd-8aa5e926aca0">Suggested alternatives: use different collection, or perhaps a structured category (this is also backwards-compatible, as opposed to a new status)</p>   
<p id="_86ee47f8-5373-49b0-a0e7-d8733b5ffb19">There is also a lack of rich text support - but that’s also true for events and tasks - this should also be addressed - see “Styled-Description” in <link target="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-douglass-calendar-extension-04.txt"/></p>   
<p id="_ec268292-a740-4ffb-9ea5-3d3d6d5d09c0">The general feeling is that JOURNAL is not heavily used.</p></clause>  
<clause id="_managed_attachments" obligation="normative">   
  <title>Managed attachments</title>   
  <p id="_766a6666-c225-43ec-b06e-62b84a80763b">Problem: we cannot add an attachment right away together with an event with managed attachments - we would have to first add an event, than once it synced and we know the uid we can add an attachment.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_support_for_wiping_devices_raised_by_marten_from_dmfs" obligation="normative"><title>Support for wiping devices (Raised by Marten from dmfs)</title><p id="_6e5f0952-9a06-441c-8d34-1641707f5a21">Do we need a special operation?</p>   
<p id="_15c6fe9d-6c70-4048-b12d-ff145628807b">The way to go is to use per-device passwords (or OAuth to get device-specific markers) and return empty collections on the first sync.</p>   
<p id="_47710f42-ef34-46d9-bc7c-ddca28c0653e">This last point led to a discussion on client authentication and whether we could perhaps support open connect. See</p>
