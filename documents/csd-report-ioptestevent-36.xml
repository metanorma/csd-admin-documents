<p id="_0af1dead-25e4-42de-b25f-1f639f2d5086">The event at HongKong continued our move to a more forum like approach, combining testing of new and standard calendar features with a number of in-depth discussions.</p>

<p id="_dd0ffbdc-7fb2-401a-9c6a-7d32f87c6477">A major topic for this event - as for the last one - is trying to make iMip more reliable. In some cases it is the representation of the data which is the issue, other times it is incorrect handling of iTip.</p>  
<p id="_73c399b2-3e33-4fcc-af56-2c2d773ea54a">Another topic which keeps coming back is dealing with differing interpretations of the iCalendar specification regarding recurrences.</p></clause>

  <title>Timezones</title>   
  <p id="_b4a53fb7-c0e4-4362-a845-f9cc829f4a29">Do servers handle timezone definition changes - e.g. recalculate recurrences based on new timezone: the answer is usually not.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_vjournal" obligation="normative"><title>VJOURNAL</title><p id="_783a7277-2624-4cb3-b451-ec9179b1f335">There was a proposal for adding an additional status to indicate “ARCHIVED”</p>   
<p id="_ee0f4767-f848-4ead-8cc5-4b7fcecc363c">Suggested alternatives: use different collection, or perhaps a structured category (this is also backwards-compatible, as opposed to a new status)</p>   
<p id="_d6ccb65b-6334-4918-9e8c-06130bbe5019">There is also a lack of rich text support - but that’s also true for events and tasks - this should also be addressed - see “Styled-Description” in <link target="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-douglass-calendar-extension-04.txt"/></p>   
<p id="_08056721-1f4c-42eb-bd68-ba82637a03a9">The general feeling is that JOURNAL is not heavily used.</p></clause>  
<clause id="_managed_attachments" obligation="normative">   
  <title>Managed attachments</title>   
  <p id="_f4d64157-fbe0-4f51-b95d-16f23d3e1353">Problem: we cannot add an attachment right away together with an event with managed attachments - we would have to first add an event, than once it synced and we know the uid we can add an attachment.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_support_for_wiping_devices_raised_by_marten_from_dmfs" obligation="normative"><title>Support for wiping devices (Raised by Marten from dmfs)</title><p id="_98e3bf81-db5b-4b46-8451-362f4fb3d7fa">Do we need a special operation?</p>   
<p id="_ad565bc1-4ecc-4f6b-ab0a-eb7afce97f27">The way to go is to use per-device passwords (or OAuth to get device-specific markers) and return empty collections on the first sync.</p>   
<p id="_6346ab3d-7e89-49c5-be90-1ba72a7a8d36">This last point led to a discussion on client authentication and whether we could perhaps support open connect. See</p>
