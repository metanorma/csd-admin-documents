<p id="_937080c3-0ec0-451d-9842-289f0d33dc36">The event at HongKong continued our move to a more forum like approach, combining testing of new and standard calendar features with a number of in-depth discussions.</p>

<p id="_504f9a56-6bf1-49d1-b171-256a7cfb1189">A major topic for this event - as for the last one - is trying to make iMip more reliable. In some cases it is the representation of the data which is the issue, other times it is incorrect handling of iTip.</p>  
<p id="_dd85de6b-1878-429e-8c36-1d2a16ea1a4c">Another topic which keeps coming back is dealing with differing interpretations of the iCalendar specification regarding recurrences.</p></clause>

  <title>Timezones</title>   
  <p id="_954099d0-cad1-4026-a6e6-1f9d09bca00d">Do servers handle timezone definition changes - e.g. recalculate recurrences based on new timezone: the answer is usually not.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_vjournal" obligation="normative"><title>VJOURNAL</title><p id="_3b68dafb-8f35-4690-9b51-956c8810bf7c">There was a proposal for adding an additional status to indicate “ARCHIVED”</p>   
<p id="_25999e7e-8a05-44f3-8761-42091555ac11">Suggested alternatives: use different collection, or perhaps a structured category (this is also backwards-compatible, as opposed to a new status)</p>   
<p id="_66d4fe58-1388-4f30-b628-39f84d1e8f4c">There is also a lack of rich text support - but that’s also true for events and tasks - this should also be addressed - see “Styled-Description” in <link target="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-douglass-calendar-extension-04.txt"/></p>   
<p id="_3306e952-2ce8-4a1a-9841-a58259eb28ab">The general feeling is that JOURNAL is not heavily used.</p></clause>  
<clause id="_managed_attachments" obligation="normative">   
  <title>Managed attachments</title>   
  <p id="_b72fa04f-5bc0-4b9c-ab4c-7b6325e9f7ab">Problem: we cannot add an attachment right away together with an event with managed attachments - we would have to first add an event, than once it synced and we know the uid we can add an attachment.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_support_for_wiping_devices_raised_by_marten_from_dmfs" obligation="normative"><title>Support for wiping devices (Raised by Marten from dmfs)</title><p id="_6f5cf242-2c6e-45fd-a983-2ac40fe75751">Do we need a special operation?</p>   
<p id="_76660359-8b10-4c8d-b6da-ed3a2d296110">The way to go is to use per-device passwords (or OAuth to get device-specific markers) and return empty collections on the first sync.</p>   
<p id="_d7d32cd3-f67b-496f-8a8a-20b067ce5b45">This last point led to a discussion on client authentication and whether we could perhaps support open connect. See</p>
