<p id="_d459b4f1-e1c7-4eca-8993-1028226609e7">The event at HongKong continued our move to a more forum like approach, combining testing of new and standard calendar features with a number of in-depth discussions.</p>
<p id="_b0e8574d-17ba-4622-8cf5-bb6ee43c57d8">The following organizations were attending</p>

<p id="_cbf24a97-bc6c-4471-a5b9-f52d41cbdeff">A major topic for this event - as for the last one - is trying to make iMip more reliable. In some cases it is the representation of the data which is the issue, other times it is incorrect handling of iTip.</p>
<p id="_f20c2644-b637-4a94-add5-bedc959ded97">Another topic which keeps coming back is dealing with differing interpretations of the iCalendar specification regarding recurrences.</p></clause>
<clause id="_discussions_and_issues_raised" obligation="normative"><title>Discussions and issues raised</title><p id="_63efdd8a-5719-4a64-b871-4a29e7067e47">During discussions a number of issues were raised. These included:</p>
<clause id="_timezones" obligation="normative">
  <title>Timezones</title>
  <p id="_b932d716-fef9-4db4-9ece-803f649ec734">Do servers handle timezone definition changes - e.g. recalculate recurrences based on new timezone: the answer is usually not.</p>
</clause>
<clause id="_vjournal" obligation="normative"><title>VJOURNAL</title><p id="_482ce1b5-7f6c-4423-9ca9-f120f7f280f5">There was a proposal for adding an additional status to indicate “ARCHIVED”</p>
<p id="_901988bc-242b-49c8-bb7a-85d6ab027f80">Suggested alternatives: use different collection, or perhaps a structured category (this is also backwards-compatible, as opposed to a new status)</p>
<p id="_6cdc1388-ed73-45d8-82af-4601165fc371">There is also a lack of rich text support - but that’s also true for events and tasks - this should also be addressed - see “Styled-Description” in <link target="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-douglass-calendar-extension-04.txt"/></p>
<p id="_302e5dfc-c0e0-4e40-99d7-c98dccc56316">The general feeling is that JOURNAL is not heavily used.</p></clause>
<clause id="_managed_attachments" obligation="normative">
  <title>Managed attachments</title>
  <p id="_e0331362-11ab-4435-b9dc-fbb412fcd7f5">Problem: we cannot add an attachment right away together with an event with managed attachments - we would have to first add an event, than once it synced and we know the uid we can add an attachment.</p>
</clause>
<clause id="_support_for_wiping_devices_raised_by_marten_from_dmfs" obligation="normative"><title>Support for wiping devices (Raised by Marten from dmfs)</title><p id="_dd6f770c-802f-4a22-a63a-f06ab5d322ce">Do we need a special operation?</p>
<p id="_68886fe8-fe36-4bf7-85c3-798b10419c31">The way to go is to use per-device passwords (or OAuth to get device-specific markers) and return empty collections on the first sync.</p>
<p id="_93353617-cd3b-484e-b14f-8c9e086bb533">This last point led to a discussion on client authentication and whether we could perhaps support open connect. See</p>

    <p id="_d5e31a42-c47c-4d97-b2e6-ceb2ab3bc9fd">isAcknowledged - as currently is it would cause gradual expansion of alerts on the instances; solution: make isAcknowledged store not boolean but the last recurrence instance for which the alert was acknowledged, and only store it on the base range, not on the instances (unless the instance has override alerts).</p>
