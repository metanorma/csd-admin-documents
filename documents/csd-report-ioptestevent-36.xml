<p id="_45a20174-b271-43d2-b77a-dca2b079caf5">The event at HongKong continued our move to a more forum like approach, combining testing of new and standard calendar features with a number of in-depth discussions.</p>

<p id="_05aba81d-b209-46ea-a462-ce35aab16fbe">A major topic for this event - as for the last one - is trying to make iMip more reliable. In some cases it is the representation of the data which is the issue, other times it is incorrect handling of iTip.</p>  
<p id="_92b5df56-06ed-47dc-83e5-a4031ebd3eae">Another topic which keeps coming back is dealing with differing interpretations of the iCalendar specification regarding recurrences.</p></clause>

  <title>Timezones</title>   
  <p id="_1813649b-5366-44d0-a0fe-770ba45b854f">Do servers handle timezone definition changes - e.g. recalculate recurrences based on new timezone: the answer is usually not.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_vjournal" obligation="normative"><title>VJOURNAL</title><p id="_24d2c736-8af6-44bc-b62c-080f659c8ed4">There was a proposal for adding an additional status to indicate “ARCHIVED”</p>   
<p id="_014b9fda-caa9-4f11-85a8-6e8af8b99d66">Suggested alternatives: use different collection, or perhaps a structured category (this is also backwards-compatible, as opposed to a new status)</p>   
<p id="_42d9fd55-4628-4434-94a0-858c499c8940">There is also a lack of rich text support - but that’s also true for events and tasks - this should also be addressed - see “Styled-Description” in <link target="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-douglass-calendar-extension-04.txt"/></p>   
<p id="_df22e15f-9f51-4eed-a879-77b9f42dd77a">The general feeling is that JOURNAL is not heavily used.</p></clause>  
<clause id="_managed_attachments" obligation="normative">   
  <title>Managed attachments</title>   
  <p id="_b0ee7657-7183-4562-b928-637e74d8f139">Problem: we cannot add an attachment right away together with an event with managed attachments - we would have to first add an event, than once it synced and we know the uid we can add an attachment.</p>   
</clause>  
<clause id="_support_for_wiping_devices_raised_by_marten_from_dmfs" obligation="normative"><title>Support for wiping devices (Raised by Marten from dmfs)</title><p id="_9390e334-338d-4fcc-954e-40ea40701368">Do we need a special operation?</p>   
<p id="_4237f430-7e06-428d-ab96-0e843bf7064f">The way to go is to use per-device passwords (or OAuth to get device-specific markers) and return empty collections on the first sync.</p>   
<p id="_ea693e6e-4ca6-41e5-9d97-7c86419a55db">This last point led to a discussion on client authentication and whether we could perhaps support open connect. See</p>
