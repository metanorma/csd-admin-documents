user-centric systems and applications.</p>

<clause id="_report" obligation="normative"><title>Report</title><p id="_befbfad7-326a-447b-bdc8-e2e9a16953ff">The Calconnect interoperability event was hosted by AOL at their Palo Alto site on January 11th through the morning of the 13th.</p>  
<p id="_46931b0a-a0bd-4141-b909-ac2d311b9b0d">While it was a smaller than usual event much valuable work took place. There was the usual mix of in-depth discussions and actual testing of implementations.</p>  
<p id="_e2b8f6fd-6ea3-4fee-947f-236ecd09f328">On the testing front there was:</p>  
<ul id="_f686271b-2e4f-42a6-aecc-1492f7335463">   
  <li>   
    <p id="_b6bd6e49-9824-4e57-8ed1-871e85ebc306">Work on the server-info document</p>   
  </li>   
  <li>   
    <p id="_f6ae30b6-6e01-4c59-8502-eca9f2bad657">CalDav Tester</p>

    <p id="_2a188813-e0ee-4844-ab9d-5532b506e996">Ralph Beckers caldav tester scripts</p>   
  </li>   
  <li>   
    <p id="_c9bcd0f8-5e67-45d4-9fe0-a3170ab544b5">General CalDAV</p>   
  </li>   
</ul>  
<p id="_f7ce169e-64e8-433c-81f6-3bdf9a637112">The server-info document is a new specification being developed to provide cacheable server information for use by clients, detailing services available and some limits. This has been implemented by a number of servers and some clients. Each interoperability event has led to changes in the specification. The general feeling is that it is now ready for wider testing and use.</p>  
<p id="_8230973a-1b2a-49c6-8072-cf440554acd9">The CalDAV tester is associated with Apple’s Darwin open source server offering and provides many tests of CardDAV, CalDAV and related features. It is very configurable. Ralph Becker’s tool helps to run the tests and store results.</p>  
<p id="_6cf6b8fa-5078-4bc6-9eb9-d45d9f1ba3f8">While historically, this has been an event focusing on interoperability testing we have been moving towards having more in-depth, developer-centric discussions on topics of interest.</p>  
<p id="_315f0095-0f08-441c-b753-4d2fd75ba31a">This event was no exception with discussions on all of the above topics as well as how best to move forward with the new developers guide.</p>  
<p id="_8a1f0e21-7810-4e74-ac2e-52ac4afdea5b">We are looking forward to being back to our usual larger attendance at Hong Kong in April. Check the website over the coming weeks as we will be updating the schedule to reflect the specific interests of the attendees,</p></clause></sections>
