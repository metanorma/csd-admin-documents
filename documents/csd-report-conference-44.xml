organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across
user-centric systems and applications.</p>
<p id="_5cefda15-2ff8-4892-a462-c7ba0931da06">CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.</p>

A Time Zone Workshop was held Tuesday afternoon during the conference. The conference was held on Google’s premises, and was attended by a total of 31 people from 11 member organizations, and 5 external invitations to the workshop.</p>
<p id="_78e77bec-3242-4122-a4b1-6644fe7029f5">This conference was organized along the guidelines from the previous conference in Karlsruhe; however, separate technical and general tracks were eliminated. Instead sessions were identified by session type. A single fee for the entire four-day conference was charged. Additionally, we schedule a “codefest” for Monday, 4 February, with open attendance.</p>
<p id="_4e023ab8-46f3-4882-b401-ef4d8919a807">The Conference focused on strategic and possible work items in addition to ongoing work, and finished with the CalConnect Plenary Session prior to lunch on Friday. Friday afternoon was scheduled for working sessions. The schedule was rearranged during the week based on input from participants. The final pre-event Conference agenda with notes on the discussion topics may be found at CalConnect XLIIV Conference Schedule.</p></introduction></preface><sections>
