organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across
user-centric systems and applications.</p>
<p id="_14a15a46-ff80-4af7-ae9d-1c44c198ac48">CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.</p>

The Developers Forum (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday morning), Data Event Summit with JEDC (the Japan Data Event Committee) (Wednesday afternoon), and Conference (late Wednesday afternoon, Thursday and Friday) were held at Jorte’s offices in Tokyo or in conference rooms in the same building.</p>
<p id="_26c11660-63a5-4824-a78c-630cd6d697a7">The CalConnect Conference was attended by a total of 12 people from 8 members. The Developers Forum had 7 participants from 4 members and was largely devoted to the forum rather than specific testing.
The Conference focussed on strategic and possible work items in addition to ongoing work, and finished with the CalConnect Plenary Session on Friday afternoon. The Conference agenda with notes on the discussion topics may be found at CalConnect XLII Conference Schedule.</p>
<p id="_0249289f-51ca-4a27-85c8-2e051de94da6">The Data Event Summit was attended by a total of 26 people, all CalConnect participants for the conference plus 15 people from JEDC, and featured presentations from two government agencies, Sharp, and our hosts. The primary focus was Japan’s efforts to ensure open data is available from their local governments (about 1800) in a common data format, and our encouragement for them to adopt the international calendaring and scheduling standards, which would require some enhancements and joint work between us.</p></introduction></preface><sections>

CalConnect will also co-publish standards with other standards organizations, or self-publish as needed.</p>
