<preface><foreword obligation="informative"><title>Foreword</title><p id="_b21a22dc-9b2a-4e49-9df2-d549dbfe701c">The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (“CalConnect”) is a global non-profit   
organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across   
user-centric systems and applications.</p>  
<p id="_c0353f7e-e8d9-4340-a4eb-27e29408208c">CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international

<clause id="_report" obligation="normative"><title>Report</title><p id="_dfca1e5e-99c4-417b-a15d-298ec563b340">The event was hosted by Oath in Sunnyvale, California, January 29-31, 2018</p>  
<p id="_9a8eeb92-7fc1-4977-a573-3c48f8d4459b">In attendance for this interoperability event and developers forum were:</p>  
<ul id="_6fdd65c6-5a35-4bd1-b1da-50621dea8a36">   
  <li>   
    <p id="_50b05695-9832-4c80-812b-821e0c3ef2e9">Mike Douglass Spherical Cow Group - managing the event</p>   
  </li>   
  <li>   
    <p id="_781df60c-e23b-4834-9772-fd7a7924409e">Ken Murchison for Fastmail</p>   
  </li>   
  <li>   
    <p id="_43155a73-135c-4e65-8b42-c8058ffec910">Thomas Schäfer for 1&amp;1</p>   
  </li>

    <p id="_c410627f-dac9-4361-ba2f-b5f1007a96ac">Peter Tam for Ribose</p>   
  </li>   
  <li>   
    <p id="_da3f7953-3a9a-4fb6-bad4-ff15c1f95a79">Richard Brigham and Anjj Kumar Tweari for Oath</p>   
  </li>   
</ul>  
<p id="_6253aab2-9d25-40b1-8272-bf12b806aebc">Despite the small attendance we managed to cover a number of topics.</p>  
<p id="_132ee000-c085-4559-826a-31d3060873c7">There was some work being done with <tt>ical4j</tt> as we continue to try to move forward to a version   
based on the latest from Ben Fortuna. Some members have heavily modified older versions but   
are getting closer. We intend to create a clone with some or all of the members’ changes which   
can be used as a staging point for pushing them up to Ben.</p>  
<p id="_a63c05e3-ac4b-4304-a469-c8cfd59568c1">There was some discussion on the work that is going on with vCard or its replacement. There   
are still questions on how to represent all the desired groups of information. It seems the   
discussions helped clarify some points.</p>  
<p id="_b1b49259-84b8-4504-a293-8652bfc646f9">There was more work trying to get the CalDAV tester running. Anuj from Oath got Darwin and   
the tester running together in record time and then proceeded to run tests against their server.</p>  
<p id="_657ac63c-1612-4802-a3a4-bc38116f3558">There was more work on updating the developers guide.</p>  
<p id="_7db3f445-04e9-462d-b0dc-4a707eb7c727">In addition we were working on getting vPoll running again as there was to be a demonstration   
in the main conference following.</p>  
<p id="_67218251-84da-4362-88ff-0705bf39f7b6">We should remind potential attendees that the developers forum and test event is as much   
about detailed discussions on points of implementation as it is about testing. It provides an   
opportunity to discuss those small details. If you do have something to test or develop then   
come early and get advice on the best path to take.</p></clause></sections>
