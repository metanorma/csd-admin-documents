organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across
user-centric systems and applications.</p>
<p id="_1dd215c3-6424-42c7-889d-3f7e2a3647b7">CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.</p>

The conference was held on 1&amp;1’s premises. The conference was attended by a total of 20 people from 10 member organizations.</p>
<p id="_f815139b-a585-4c61-b247-3072610e5fc9">This conference was a one-time experiment with a new conference format, technical and conference tracks alternating each day, and a single fee rather than the previous separate fees for the test event and conference. It was also a 4-day event, Monday through Thursday, rather than the 5 days that the previous format required to attend both the test event and the conference. The new format was based on recommendations from a working group set up by the CalConnect Board at the beginning of the year, to examine the current formats and make recommendations for future changes.</p>
<p id="_e3796b53-7c61-4905-b53f-e2a568aa6bdd">The Conference focussed on strategic and possible work items in addition to ongoing work, and finished with the CalConnect Plenary Session prior to lunch on Thursday. Thursday afternoon was open time for working sessions. The schedule was rearranged during the week based on input from participants. The final Conference agenda with notes on the discussion topics may be found at CalConnect XLIII Conference Schedule.</p></introduction></preface><sections>

CalConnect will also co-publish standards with other standards organizations, or self-publish as needed.</p>

<p id="_f64a7912-17bd-47d6-803f-84fd00de5d1b">CalConnect is planning to resume its practice of self-publishing standards, which hasn’t been done for some time as much of its work has focused on extensions to existing IETF specifications (many of which were also developed by CalConnect). To further this work, new CalConnect Standards Directives have been written to bring our document requirement and progression and publishing policies and procedures in line with ISO and other international standards organizations. The Plenary meeting approved a recommendation to the CalConnect Board of Directors to adopt the draft directives.</p>
<p id="_94723bfc-2923-47ac-bb99-fd47f99e2ab7">Feedback was obtained on the new conference format being tried at this event (as a one-time trial) as noted above. In general the format is well thought of, several adjustments were made to the schedule as the week progressed.</p>
