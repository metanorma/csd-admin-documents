organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across   
user-centric systems and applications.</p>  
<p id="_48b1f9cd-4c6f-469e-899c-c9ca5ff24b10">CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international

<p id="_84f574de-69ca-4f86-93b1-750f95458b3e">In attendance for this interoperability event and developers forum were representatives from</p>  
<ul id="_309a8251-e74c-410b-a01c-aaba1776740a">   
  <li>   
    <p id="_3c4f03aa-5f98-4cad-b416-21bfb07390d3">Spherical Cow Group</p>

  </li>   
</ul>  
<p id="_be675105-38c9-404d-91fa-474c81cc171e">Despite that small attendance we were all kept busy on a number of issues which required discussion and implementation.</p>  
<p id="_c307dca3-00a0-43d3-9342-2779c6316e67">Vpoll was being worked on by Robert Stepanek of FastMail in preparation for a presentation and demonstration in the conference.</p>  
<p id="_533fbbdb-02ee-42e7-ad27-22ce398a0ac7">We had further discussions on the new JSCalendar specification Robert is working on. As the specification nears completion there are some remaining issues. The description property and localization, client-side alarm handling amd attendee-specific sequencing. As ever there were discussions about various aspects of recurrences.</p>  
<p id="_4781120f-f7d9-4785-99bb-6992ee79cd13">The new server side subscriptions specification was discussed and the Open-Xchange members carried out a preliminary implementation of the specification. This specification allows DAV clients to POST subscription requests to the server which then manages the synchronization of the data. Open-Xchange proposed some additions be added: a “refresh now” option for clients and persisting and signaling account errors to clients. These most likely will be added to the final specification.</p>  
<p id="_af4d99ed-bd83-4513-8468-0899eb43dfac">We talked about the progress being made with the VObject and VCard work in preparation for presentations later in the week.</p>  
<p id="_8040163c-9741-4ba7-b59f-a63398df3aca">Apart from the larger issues above these meetings provided the opportunity for face-to-face in depth discussion on various topics.</p></clause></sections>
