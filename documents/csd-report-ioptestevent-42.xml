organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across   
user-centric systems and applications.</p>  
<p id="_b72a05fb-f8f4-4934-8b29-f941f60e6464">CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international

<p id="_0ea7d4c1-b904-4aef-8c04-4d2cc17ca75b">In attendance for this interoperability event and developers forum were representatives from</p>  
<ul id="_b278ea5a-87db-42b6-a849-53301ed5456d">   
  <li>   
    <p id="_fa307b17-0982-45a1-8399-7577a63a4bad">Spherical Cow Group</p>

  </li>   
</ul>  
<p id="_f95135ab-7f4f-4847-b4b7-48279ab8918c">Despite that small attendance we were all kept busy on a number of issues which required discussion and implementation.</p>  
<p id="_9435a860-8fbf-4bc1-aca2-1c3adcc088b3">Vpoll was being worked on by Robert Stepanek of FastMail in preparation for a presentation and demonstration in the conference.</p>  
<p id="_60d2491f-945e-48fb-bf06-0efd3496bd3e">We had further discussions on the new JSCalendar specification Robert is working on. As the specification nears completion there are some remaining issues. The description property and localization, client-side alarm handling amd attendee-specific sequencing. As ever there were discussions about various aspects of recurrences.</p>  
<p id="_af6519e6-b7e5-435b-b22a-1797a1cd8a33">The new server side subscriptions specification was discussed and the Open-Xchange members carried out a preliminary implementation of the specification. This specification allows DAV clients to POST subscription requests to the server which then manages the synchronization of the data. Open-Xchange proposed some additions be added: a “refresh now” option for clients and persisting and signaling account errors to clients. These most likely will be added to the final specification.</p>  
<p id="_a076dc03-4d1c-4bcf-b714-382f5090d52d">We talked about the progress being made with the VObject and VCard work in preparation for presentations later in the week.</p>  
<p id="_39cb49dd-8ef9-4d6c-b712-d479351547fd">Apart from the larger issues above these meetings provided the opportunity for face-to-face in depth discussion on various topics.</p></clause></sections>
