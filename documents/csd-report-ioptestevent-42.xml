organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across   
user-centric systems and applications.</p>  
<p id="_bad14a90-5bdd-43d8-85b5-318734cc5091">CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international

<clause id="_report" obligation="normative"><title>Report</title><p id="_7798fb09-e210-4e5f-b3f2-c3fea498895a">The event was hosted by Jorte in Tokyo, Japan, June 4-8, 2018</p>  
<p id="_35297eab-2fc1-48a0-81c9-671792968069">In attendance for this interoperability event and developers forum were representatives from</p>  
<ul id="_1d2849c2-7d73-4a27-a152-3773019577e2">   
  <li>   
    <p id="_e81f00b6-f434-4e55-a9a8-26b1bf5f0713">Spherical Cow Group</p>

  </li>   
</ul>  
<p id="_5ba90203-a659-4f79-a600-526f286c71bc">Despite that small attendance we were all kept busy on a number of issues which required discussion and implementation.</p>  
<p id="_392a1d0d-79c9-4b0a-9c8d-430357860a45">Vpoll was being worked on by Robert Stepanek of FastMail in preparation for a presentation and demonstration in the conference.</p>  
<p id="_8b3fbab4-cb30-4e27-96c7-ecb1581309a4">We had further discussions on the new JSCalendar specification Robert is working on. As the specification nears completion there are some remaining issues. The description property and localization, client-side alarm handling amd attendee-specific sequencing. As ever there were discussions about various aspects of recurrences.</p>  
<p id="_06ee4e14-6527-4ea1-a64a-be099ba61a48">The new server side subscriptions specification was discussed and the Open-Xchange members carried out a preliminary implementation of the specification. This specification allows DAV clients to POST subscription requests to the server which then manages the synchronization of the data. Open-Xchange proposed some additions be added: a “refresh now” option for clients and persisting and signaling account errors to clients. These most likely will be added to the final specification.</p>  
<p id="_ea9576f4-2765-4e90-9822-61b4a0d1404c">We talked about the progress being made with the VObject and VCard work in preparation for presentations later in the week.</p>  
<p id="_426b64cb-8eb8-4b8b-a491-d392040a5058">Apart from the larger issues above these meetings provided the opportunity for face-to-face in depth discussion on various topics.</p></clause></sections>
