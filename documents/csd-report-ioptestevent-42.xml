<preface><foreword obligation="informative"><title>Foreword</title><p id="_717d3178-3533-4faf-b048-4328589b303d">The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (“CalConnect”) is a global non-profit
organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across
user-centric systems and applications.</p>
<p id="_56800d60-8335-4159-a81b-6f3a0dbbcf00">CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.</p>

<clause id="_report" obligation="normative"><title>Report</title><p id="_44e8ec11-08ce-4680-b0b0-9e286784fd5a">The event was hosted by Jorte in Tokyo, Japan, June 4-8, 2018</p>
<p id="_9ee84950-695f-45af-8cb0-c7b60cd87ecf">In attendance for this interoperability event and developers forum were representatives from</p>

    <p id="_68d016bc-4214-4025-9ddc-15c5ca31a2f2">Spherical Cow Group</p>

  </li>
</ul>
<p id="_3e9c25f8-4f10-4fc5-8ac7-12dcddef6d2b">Despite that small attendance we were all kept busy on a number of issues which required discussion and implementation.</p>
<p id="_3f0ad8c5-fdfb-4c8f-9d00-4ef5d603c538">Vpoll was being worked on by Robert Stepanek of FastMail in preparation for a presentation and demonstration in the conference.</p>
<p id="_e2b47e95-6bf5-49cf-8337-f5a76de9de79">We had further discussions on the new JSCalendar specification Robert is working on. As the specification nears completion there are some remaining issues. The description property and localization, client-side alarm handling amd attendee-specific sequencing. As ever there were discussions about various aspects of recurrences.</p>
<p id="_a023a54c-7112-4fb8-a356-2d38abb6b98c">The new server side subscriptions specification was discussed and the Open-Xchange members carried out a preliminary implementation of the specification. This specification allows DAV clients to POST subscription requests to the server which then manages the synchronization of the data. Open-Xchange proposed some additions be added: a “refresh now” option for clients and persisting and signaling account errors to clients. These most likely will be added to the final specification.</p>
<p id="_9af09f16-1575-49e7-9e58-bcf1976a175d">We talked about the progress being made with the VObject and VCard work in preparation for presentations later in the week.</p>
<p id="_7b349c84-ae78-4964-bc74-4214cd213933">Apart from the larger issues above these meetings provided the opportunity for face-to-face in depth discussion on various topics.</p></clause></sections>
