<preface><foreword obligation="informative"><title>Foreword</title><p id="_299c783b-4761-4efe-bbe1-9c3a08ce5a3d">The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (“CalConnect”) is a global non-profit   
organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across   
user-centric systems and applications.</p>  
<p id="_c33746cb-85b9-49a1-8e07-1c91b2c86f54">CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international   
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.</p>

<clause id="_report" obligation="normative"><title>Report</title><p id="_66109a8e-4d79-4440-b6ea-98f507f9cf8e">The event was hosted by Jorte in Tokyo, Japan, June 4-8, 2018</p>  
<p id="_4a2e35b8-73bf-481d-bdd1-22bb2724475f">In attendance for this interoperability event and developers forum were representatives from</p>  
<ul id="_f600c8fe-578d-4004-a3e6-49ee6f1e997a">   
  <li>   
    <p id="_9106eb82-9a6e-4cde-b7d6-4223fc83e535">Spherical Cow Group</p>

  <li>   
    <p id="_316988a4-5de8-4559-9e2a-077c3bde3cce">FastMail</p>

    <p id="_3a72ae44-4846-41f9-b943-5dfad7fc6670">Open-Xchange</p>

  </li>   
</ul>  
<p id="_a9b75e71-e04a-4846-9429-81d9c261e757">Despite that small attendance we were all kept busy on a number of issues which required discussion and implementation.</p>  
<p id="_559d55d8-e1bf-4b41-941a-489a350bfe67">Vpoll was being worked on by Robert Stepanek of FastMail in preparation for a presentation and demonstration in the conference.</p>  
<p id="_d35cf66c-44ec-467c-bb6a-0b0bfdf1600f">We had further discussions on the new JSCalendar specification Robert is working on. As the specification nears completion there are some remaining issues. The description property and localization, client-side alarm handling amd attendee-specific sequencing. As ever there were discussions about various aspects of recurrences.</p>  
<p id="_d4f62d9d-4b85-4d18-aae4-5fce9c2448ec">The new server side subscriptions specification was discussed and the Open-Xchange members carried out a preliminary implementation of the specification. This specification allows DAV clients to POST subscription requests to the server which then manages the synchronization of the data. Open-Xchange proposed some additions be added: a “refresh now” option for clients and persisting and signaling account errors to clients. These most likely will be added to the final specification.</p>  
<p id="_dffc5444-3682-4931-b875-535e5d6e1500">We talked about the progress being made with the VObject and VCard work in preparation for presentations later in the week.</p>  
<p id="_4af42af6-f30b-4092-87e6-9d56d778ff96">Apart from the larger issues above these meetings provided the opportunity for face-to-face in depth discussion on various topics.</p></clause></sections>
