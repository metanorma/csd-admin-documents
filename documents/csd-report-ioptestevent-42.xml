organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across   
user-centric systems and applications.</p>  
<p id="_226e73c8-a3bb-464f-96fd-b99686bec0f6">CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international   
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.</p>

<clause id="_report" obligation="normative"><title>Report</title><p id="_1fac8640-151c-4fb6-b933-2b3a4b18a8c4">The event was hosted by Jorte in Tokyo, Japan, June 4-8, 2018</p>  
<p id="_25412b43-c304-4f1a-aca4-8ee7d413772f">In attendance for this interoperability event and developers forum were representatives from</p>  
<ul id="_b8c6d5f4-615c-4190-a143-0cb96893f636">   
  <li>   
    <p id="_50c947ed-17ea-4882-8331-6760c41f6136">Spherical Cow Group</p>

  </li>   
</ul>  
<p id="_7e1e7dda-1a9b-42d5-90bb-8aeec7ed5472">Despite that small attendance we were all kept busy on a number of issues which required discussion and implementation.</p>  
<p id="_81e7775d-8c99-434d-870c-7ee04f6ced4f">Vpoll was being worked on by Robert Stepanek of FastMail in preparation for a presentation and demonstration in the conference.</p>  
<p id="_ecf19064-4688-4c75-9f72-5feeb87e3b15">We had further discussions on the new JSCalendar specification Robert is working on. As the specification nears completion there are some remaining issues. The description property and localization, client-side alarm handling amd attendee-specific sequencing. As ever there were discussions about various aspects of recurrences.</p>  
<p id="_24dcd4d3-14f3-4f0a-a397-595867b79ae2">The new server side subscriptions specification was discussed and the Open-Xchange members carried out a preliminary implementation of the specification. This specification allows DAV clients to POST subscription requests to the server which then manages the synchronization of the data. Open-Xchange proposed some additions be added: a “refresh now” option for clients and persisting and signaling account errors to clients. These most likely will be added to the final specification.</p>  
<p id="_e44ca57d-88b6-4ff2-af1d-882032260536">We talked about the progress being made with the VObject and VCard work in preparation for presentations later in the week.</p>  
<p id="_4a22d7d8-5062-4c64-911f-70ded2241a6f">Apart from the larger issues above these meetings provided the opportunity for face-to-face in depth discussion on various topics.</p></clause></sections>
