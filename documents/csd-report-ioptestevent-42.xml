organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across   
user-centric systems and applications.</p>  
<p id="_008e1a6b-0fe9-4b76-b625-e485319ee2d5">CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international   
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.</p>

<clause id="_report" obligation="normative"><title>Report</title><p id="_2ba0f507-c90e-4a21-ae6d-0b1f2e49a9c5">The event was hosted by Jorte in Tokyo, Japan, June 4-8, 2018</p>  
<p id="_85fd374f-ecda-4019-9d06-583c4818ba42">In attendance for this interoperability event and developers forum were representatives from</p>  
<ul id="_3cb988ee-fdc6-45a6-9666-df9e406297e9">   
  <li>   
    <p id="_cbfded5a-b7ff-4514-aafa-3fda1d3bbfe9">Spherical Cow Group</p>   
  </li>

  </li>   
</ul>  
<p id="_91379402-bd44-488d-8671-8a1c6bed0a11">Despite that small attendance we were all kept busy on a number of issues which required discussion and implementation.</p>  
<p id="_5238058d-9542-47b9-b82a-0cf2fcd70f9e">Vpoll was being worked on by Robert Stepanek of FastMail in preparation for a presentation and demonstration in the conference.</p>  
<p id="_95843fc4-6007-4a04-a954-2134f56bd47a">We had further discussions on the new JSCalendar specification Robert is working on. As the specification nears completion there are some remaining issues. The description property and localization, client-side alarm handling amd attendee-specific sequencing. As ever there were discussions about various aspects of recurrences.</p>  
<p id="_f2063172-d7e6-4bf8-9c20-ef93089eae6c">The new server side subscriptions specification was discussed and the Open-Xchange members carried out a preliminary implementation of the specification. This specification allows DAV clients to POST subscription requests to the server which then manages the synchronization of the data. Open-Xchange proposed some additions be added: a “refresh now” option for clients and persisting and signaling account errors to clients. These most likely will be added to the final specification.</p>  
<p id="_83aa7040-a078-45ba-a28d-3b5c14e540b0">We talked about the progress being made with the VObject and VCard work in preparation for presentations later in the week.</p>  
<p id="_c50c3292-3fb0-4e04-97be-94e74b0be690">Apart from the larger issues above these meetings provided the opportunity for face-to-face in depth discussion on various topics.</p></clause></sections>
