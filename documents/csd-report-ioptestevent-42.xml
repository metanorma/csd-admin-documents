organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across   
user-centric systems and applications.</p>  
<p id="_941ce5c4-2434-4295-a125-14231f7bd6ec">CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international   
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.</p>

<p id="_40976b8e-280b-4da7-8f4c-2e515f4b2ad0">In attendance for this interoperability event and developers forum were representatives from</p>  
<ul id="_3d46afa1-7413-4d5d-bcc4-ed887ca943ce">   
  <li>   
    <p id="_85f9d8b0-81bc-4160-96ea-d835db8bbb53">Spherical Cow Group</p>

</ul>  
<p id="_3b0ae2be-49f9-4d61-877b-a1feef200331">Despite that small attendance we were all kept busy on a number of issues which required discussion and implementation.</p>  
<p id="_25d90338-44b9-4c10-8460-8565602cc5fc">Vpoll was being worked on by Robert Stepanek of FastMail in preparation for a presentation and demonstration in the conference.</p>  
<p id="_8e546a40-2016-4aaf-975b-7f107e86459b">We had further discussions on the new JSCalendar specification Robert is working on. As the specification nears completion there are some remaining issues. The description property and localization, client-side alarm handling amd attendee-specific sequencing. As ever there were discussions about various aspects of recurrences.</p>  
<p id="_22712cf6-3abc-44ba-b516-0632c2449fc8">The new server side subscriptions specification was discussed and the Open-Xchange members carried out a preliminary implementation of the specification. This specification allows DAV clients to POST subscription requests to the server which then manages the synchronization of the data. Open-Xchange proposed some additions be added: a “refresh now” option for clients and persisting and signaling account errors to clients. These most likely will be added to the final specification.</p>  
<p id="_bcef9441-3b65-4088-9c0b-44fd55fae0ec">We talked about the progress being made with the VObject and VCard work in preparation for presentations later in the week.</p>  
<p id="_e073637c-d432-433d-af26-9e9d716adf7b">Apart from the larger issues above these meetings provided the opportunity for face-to-face in depth discussion on various topics.</p></clause></sections>
