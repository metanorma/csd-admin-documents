organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across   
user-centric systems and applications.</p>

<p id="_ead010a2-7b44-401a-a75e-3d2cab04f9fe">In attendance for this interoperability event and developers forum were representatives from</p>  
<ul id="_f625877e-f06d-4832-bbb7-ce3be0c78889">   
  <li>   
    <p id="_164438d3-e199-4f2d-bc00-3517af7456f8">Spherical Cow Group</p>

  </li>   
</ul>  
<p id="_0433b97e-94b8-45a9-b829-18eb39eca894">Despite that small attendance we were all kept busy on a number of issues which required discussion and implementation.</p>  
<p id="_78bd56c9-ce6e-48e2-b526-1aa739e1184c">Vpoll was being worked on by Robert Stepanek of FastMail in preparation for a presentation and demonstration in the conference.</p>  
<p id="_239ecb65-3597-404a-8b47-86eea0387fe6">We had further discussions on the new JSCalendar specification Robert is working on. As the specification nears completion there are some remaining issues. The description property and localization, client-side alarm handling amd attendee-specific sequencing. As ever there were discussions about various aspects of recurrences.</p>  
<p id="_38621503-6d4b-4f6d-8552-ea5b4c67d7e8">The new server side subscriptions specification was discussed and the Open-Xchange members carried out a preliminary implementation of the specification. This specification allows DAV clients to POST subscription requests to the server which then manages the synchronization of the data. Open-Xchange proposed some additions be added: a “refresh now” option for clients and persisting and signaling account errors to clients. These most likely will be added to the final specification.</p>  
<p id="_0d30487c-63bd-41bc-a974-f3cce94cf0a5">We talked about the progress being made with the VObject and VCard work in preparation for presentations later in the week.</p>  
<p id="_378d3ece-4658-466f-8ad2-e6d82c00a707">Apart from the larger issues above these meetings provided the opportunity for face-to-face in depth discussion on various topics.</p></clause></sections>
