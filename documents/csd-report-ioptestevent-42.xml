organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across   
user-centric systems and applications.</p>  
<p id="_d4eba2da-8d4d-4fdf-b6a1-46fe77be93da">CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international   
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.</p>

<p id="_1823f32a-8380-467e-928b-60d27ecd8e85">In attendance for this interoperability event and developers forum were representatives from</p>

  <li>   
    <p id="_0dd53567-2810-4da7-a34f-38da88a4c90b">Spherical Cow Group</p>

</ul>  
<p id="_4e62b731-5520-4021-83d4-831897dc5fd1">Despite that small attendance we were all kept busy on a number of issues which required discussion and implementation.</p>  
<p id="_4dd75d92-3a9d-4688-9f5e-852d422348d4">Vpoll was being worked on by Robert Stepanek of FastMail in preparation for a presentation and demonstration in the conference.</p>  
<p id="_0d30a17e-4074-4800-b619-30d9a605f124">We had further discussions on the new JSCalendar specification Robert is working on. As the specification nears completion there are some remaining issues. The description property and localization, client-side alarm handling amd attendee-specific sequencing. As ever there were discussions about various aspects of recurrences.</p>  
<p id="_fc2e0bb0-9fa5-4a65-8439-d26bdccf7ee4">The new server side subscriptions specification was discussed and the Open-Xchange members carried out a preliminary implementation of the specification. This specification allows DAV clients to POST subscription requests to the server which then manages the synchronization of the data. Open-Xchange proposed some additions be added: a “refresh now” option for clients and persisting and signaling account errors to clients. These most likely will be added to the final specification.</p>  
<p id="_4d1efaef-d4b5-43a1-93a7-f40052b7b0c6">We talked about the progress being made with the VObject and VCard work in preparation for presentations later in the week.</p>  
<p id="_c95ff0f2-948f-46dd-b211-8fe48601b32e">Apart from the larger issues above these meetings provided the opportunity for face-to-face in depth discussion on various topics.</p></clause></sections>
