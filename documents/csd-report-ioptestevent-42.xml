<preface><foreword obligation="informative"><title>Foreword</title><p id="_373a107c-3e53-4351-bdc9-6c37f1fd5638">The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (“CalConnect”) is global non-profit
organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across
user-centric systems and applications.</p>
<p id="_5f70756b-d988-43ed-8610-505bd10b3e0e">CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.</p>

<p id="_bbd73078-03c3-40c1-8cc3-0db5c94f4914">In attendance for this interoperability event and developers forum were representatives from</p>

  </li>
</ul>
<p id="_610dacb8-e091-462b-9d61-c4c6eec9e965">Despite that small attendance we were all kept busy on a number of issues which required discussion and implementation.</p>
<p id="_d7c718a5-a77b-47f8-824c-f61779c109f6">Vpoll was being worked on by Robert Stepanek of FastMail in preparation for a presentation and demonstration in the conference.</p>
<p id="_beedb80f-56f4-4420-be4b-ebab7d7a182b">We had further discussions on the new JSCalendar specification Robert is working on. As the specification nears completion there are some remaining issues. The description property and localization, client-side alarm handling amd attendee-specific sequencing. As ever there were discussions about various aspects of recurrences.</p>
<p id="_98b080cf-32f2-43c6-b6b7-a1c708ce99eb">The new server side subscriptions specification was discussed and the Open-Xchange members carried out a preliminary implementation of the specification. This specification allows DAV clients to POST subscription requests to the server which then manages the synchronization of the data. Open-Xchange proposed some additions be added: a “refresh now” option for clients and persisting and signaling account errors to clients. These most likely will be added to the final specification.</p>
<p id="_17f3c88d-fa43-493e-bb2b-fe1ed6cab045">We talked about the progress being made with the VObject and VCard work in preparation for presentations later in the week.</p>
<p id="_699d78b9-e1cb-483e-a747-2781a34f7d22">Apart from the larger issues above these meetings provided the opportunity for face-to-face in depth discussion on various topics.</p></clause></sections>
