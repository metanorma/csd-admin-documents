<preface><foreword obligation="informative"><title>Foreword</title><p id="_991fd6c9-2601-4a62-8343-ee3bafd4609b">The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (“CalConnect”) is a global non-profit   
organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across   
user-centric systems and applications.</p>  
<p id="_455c9446-84bb-48d5-a7b8-19db19563edc">CalConnect works closely with liaison partners including international   
organizations such as ISO, OASIS and M3AAWG.</p>

<p id="_dde4fbae-9b03-458d-9ad0-9088631702e9">In attendance for this interoperability event and developers forum were representatives from</p>

  <li>   
    <p id="_8302e7ed-f109-426f-b15a-0b5d02131d3a">Spherical Cow Group</p>

</ul>  
<p id="_b009fb34-f373-4669-8357-9de1f39456d4">Despite that small attendance we were all kept busy on a number of issues which required discussion and implementation.</p>  
<p id="_51a8a092-fd78-42ec-b98c-bd7a39613eb5">Vpoll was being worked on by Robert Stepanek of FastMail in preparation for a presentation and demonstration in the conference.</p>  
<p id="_2b909f42-1d24-4487-b390-506bf420ee86">We had further discussions on the new JSCalendar specification Robert is working on. As the specification nears completion there are some remaining issues. The description property and localization, client-side alarm handling amd attendee-specific sequencing. As ever there were discussions about various aspects of recurrences.</p>  
<p id="_faed352d-cf33-4c50-b627-3c63a5c966fe">The new server side subscriptions specification was discussed and the Open-Xchange members carried out a preliminary implementation of the specification. This specification allows DAV clients to POST subscription requests to the server which then manages the synchronization of the data. Open-Xchange proposed some additions be added: a “refresh now” option for clients and persisting and signaling account errors to clients. These most likely will be added to the final specification.</p>  
<p id="_0f0e5d5e-c842-4b41-8643-af4441cea6aa">We talked about the progress being made with the VObject and VCard work in preparation for presentations later in the week.</p>  
<p id="_abbfcfd4-4a82-44a6-bef4-8bc83c66d41b">Apart from the larger issues above these meetings provided the opportunity for face-to-face in depth discussion on various topics.</p></clause></sections>
